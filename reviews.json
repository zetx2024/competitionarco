    "review": "It was such pleasure to work with you all. But I wish we had more time to complete the assignments as most of us are beginners. It would have been much better and beginner friendly in that way. But the overall experience was so good and the people organizing it were so friendly and nice. I will say these people are so dedicated individuals."
