It provided me a ground to showcase my abilities, challenged me for critical thinking, and aspired me to aim higher. I am eternally grateful that I can be in a place to share my experiences and contribute to encouraging others, because by now, too, I've been encouraged enough by the stories of so many before me. Long story short, Hats off to IARCO!"

    "review": "As the Silver Prize winner of IARCO 2024, I am immensely grateful for the incredible opportunity to practice and showcase everything I had learned, especially from the Youth Research Journal program I was a student of prior. Participating in this competition significantly honed my research skills, and the excellent workshops conducted by some of the brightest minds in the field were instrumental in my success. The event was very well-structured, with concise and detailed guidelines, ensuring that every resource we needed was readily available--- from guidelines, lectures and even examples of what was expected of us as participants. This inclusive approach made it accessible even for participants with little to no prior experience in research, encouraging everyone to give it a shot. One of the most exciting parts of the competition for me was creating the video pitch. It allowed me to present the significance of my chosen topic and put into practice everything I had worked on in my proposal. It was a perfect opportunity to merge creativity with research and demonstrate my insights in a compelling way. Truthfully, I tend to work last-minute, and there were moments when I doubted whether I’d even make it to the top 10. Winning Silver felt surreal and deeply rewarding. I am endlessly thankful to IARCO for providing this platform. I hope this inspires others to step out of their comfort zones and explore the exciting world of research."

    "review": "No matter how many lemons life gives you, keep making lemonade with a smile. There will be moments when it feels overwhelming and others that fill you with joy—that’s the nature of life. Be grateful not only for what you’ve achieved but also for what you haven’t, as it may not have been meant for you. Gratitude and forgiveness go hand in hand. Show kindness and compassion because you never truly know what others are going through. Even if you reach great heights, remain humble and treat everyone with respect. Life will bring new people and experiences your way—welcome them and learn from each one. Mistakes are not reasons for grief; they are valuable lessons. If you act unjustly or behave rudely toward someone, sincerely apologize without delay. Remember, it’s not your achievements but your behavior that truly defines your character. And lastly, never forget—no matter what challenges come your way, you must keep going. Never give up."
