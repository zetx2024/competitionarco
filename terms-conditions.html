Hosts, mentors, and advisors also have an obligation to avoid purposefully or inadvertently pressuring teams to make a particular investment recommendation.</p>

        <p>To avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, each participant must disclose to the competition team in writing any potential conflicts, including but not limited to any ownership interest in the subject company and any close personal or professional relationships with employees at the subject company. Judges and graders must further disclose any close personal or professional relationship with team members, mentors, or faculty advisors. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed promptly upon becoming aware of the potential conflict.</p>

        <p>The competition management will investigate any disclosures of actual or potential conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest is found to exist and cannot be reasonably and timely cured, the individual with the conflict of interest will be disqualified from participation. If the competition management determines that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the competition, the competition management April disqualify a team from the competition if any team member, industry mentor, or faculty advisor is found to have a conflict of interest that is incapable of being reasonably and timely cured.
