<br>
<h2>8. Intellectual Property.</h2>

<p>By submitting your entry, you understand that the
Promoter, anyone acting on behalf of the Promoter, or its respective licensees,
successors, and assigns will have the worldwide irrevocable right to review, print,
publish, broadcast, distribute, and use, in any media, in perpetuity, your entry,
including without limitation, the entry and your name, portrait, picture, voice,
likeness, image or information for trade, advertising, public relations and
promotional purposes, without any further compensation.</p>



<br>
<h2>9. Personal data</h2>

<p>Any personal information or other information about you collected
by the Promoter through, or in connection with, the competition is subject to our
Privacy Policy. Your personal data, such as your name and your email address, will
be processed by the Promoter for the purposes of your participation in this
competition and to provide you with information and promotions about the
Promoter and/or any of its affiliates that we deem could be of interest to you. We

other business partners both within and outside Bangladesh. The Promoter and
its affiliates may also use your personal data, combined with information about
you obtained from third-party sources, to market our products and services,

has been collected or in accordance with time limits stipulated by law and good
market practice unless further retention is necessary for compliance with a legal

obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>



<br>
<h2>10. Conflict Of Interest</h2>

<p>All participants in the competition, including hosts, teams, team members,
industry mentors, faculty advisors, judges, and graders have an obligation to avoid
actual or potential conflicts of interest with their participation. A conflict of
interest is any matter that could reasonably be expected to impair an individual’s
independence and objectivity or interfere with an individual’s duties. A conflict
may be actual or perceived. For example, a conflict of interest may exist when a
participant or a participant’s family member or close friend is involved in activities
that affect the participant’s ability to perform their role fairly and impartially, but
conflicts of interest can arise even without a personal relationship. Hosts, mentors,
and advisors also have an obligation to avoid purposefully or inadvertently
pressuring teams to make a particular investment recommendation.</p>
<br>
<p>To avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, each participant must
disclose to the competition team in writing any potential conflicts, including but
not limited to any ownership interest in the subject company and any close
personal or professional relationships with employees at the subject company.
Judges and graders must further disclose any close personal or professional
relationship with team members, mentors, or faculty advisors. Potential conflicts
of interest must be disclosed promptly upon becoming aware of the potential
conflict.</p>
<br>
<p>The competition management will investigate any disclosures of actual or
potential conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest is found to exist and cannot
be reasonably and timely cured, the individual with the conflict of interest will be
disqualified from participation. If the competition management determines that
it is necessary to protect the integrity of the competition, the competition
management may disqualify a team from the competition if any team member,
industry mentor, or faculty advisor is found to have a conflict of interest that is
incapable of being reasonably and timely cured. In extraordinary circumstances
where a local level host is found to have a conflict of interest, the competition
management may, at its discretion, disqualify the local level host and all teams
<br>
from that location from participating in the research competition. The decision of
the management regarding the existence of a conflict of interest and its
determination regarding the disqualification of any individual or team are final
and binding.</p>



<br>
<h2>11. Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Plagiarism is defined as copying or using in substantially the same form materials
prepared by others without acknowledging the source of the material or
identifying the author and publisher of such material. Teams can read existing
research on the subject company, but all analysis should be their own; they may
not copy analysis (i.e., plagiarize) from another source.</p>
<br>
<p>Allegations of plagiarism will be investigated by the competition management
(with assistance as necessary from the local level host) and may be referred to the
Professional Conduct Program. Participants found to have plagiarized will be
disqualified and reported to the competition management Professional Conduct
Program. The decision of the competition management regarding plagiarism is
final and binding.</p>
<br>

<h2>Participants also must not:</h2>
<p>11.1. use excerpts from articles or reports prepared by others either verbatim or
with only slight changes in wording without acknowledgment,</p>
<p>11.2. cite specific quotations as attributable to “leading analysts” and
“investment experts” without naming the specific references,</p>
<p>11.3. present statistical estimates of forecasts prepared by others and identifying
