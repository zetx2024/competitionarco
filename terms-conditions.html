            <p>The promoter of this competition is Youth Research Journal, an organization incorporated under the laws of Bangladesh with registration number 01/B-2932 (the "Promoter", "us", "we"). Information on how to enter and the prizes form part of these conditions of entry (the "Terms of Participation").</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>1.1. Entry is open to residents of all countries. Students must be currently attending a secondary or high school or university at the timeline of the global competition in May - October 2025 OR have graduated but not yet enrolled in university or enrolled studies before July 2025.</p>

        <p>1.2. If you are a minor over the age of 16 but under the age of 18, you should review these Terms and Conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure you both understand them. We require parental consent to award the prize to participants under 18 who are selected as winners of any of the prizes. If we learn that we have collected information from an individual under the age of 16 without parental consent, then we will delete that information as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>1.3. We may ask you to provide proof of identity, residency, and age, to confirm that you are eligible to participate.</p>
        <p>1.4. You may only enter once and in your own name.</p>

        <p>1.5. If you (or your immediate family or housemates) are employees or contractors of the Promoter, or its subsidiaries or parent or affiliated companies, then you're not eligible to participate.</p>

        <p>1.6. The laws in some places may not allow the Promoter to run such promotions, so this competition and these Terms of Participation are void in those places.</p>

        <h2>2. Registration</h2>

        <p>2.1. Registration in the competition constitutes acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. The IARCO Team reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions without notice and at its sole discretion.</p>

        <p>2.2. The registration fee must be paid by credit card at the time of registration individually.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>2.2.1. Early Bird Registration:</strong> $15 (BDT 500 for Bangladeshi participants only) per student. Registration period: May 1st - June 28th, 2025</p>

        <p>2.2.4. Students may reduce the registration fee by using a promo code (not accessible upon request).</p>

        <p>2.3. All correspondence regarding the IARCO 2025 Competition will be made through the nominated contact details provided when registering. These emails must NOT be school emails.</p>

        <p>2.4. IARCO 2025 is not responsible for updating incorrect email addresses.</p>

        <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>

        <p>3.1. Registration fees are non-refundable.</p>
        <p>3.2. By paying the registration fee and submitting your registration form, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to IARCO's no-refund policy.</p>

        <h2>4. Competition Rules</h2>

        <p>4.1. IARCO 2025 Research topic: Researchers can choose a topic they're passionate about, something they wish to dive deeper into, or something they want to study in university.</p>

        <p>4.2. All changes will be published on the competition website, www.iarco.org.</p>

        <p>4.3. Individuals must submit their work before the specified deadlines - no late submissions will be accepted.</p>

        <p>4.4. By submitting your work, you confirm that all of your entries are your own work. It's your responsibility to make sure that your entry doesn't infringe on any third-party rights.</p>

        <p>4.5. Note that no scores, comments, or marked judging rubrics will be provided to participants for first round submissions due to the high volume of submissions.</p>

        <h2>5. Competition Structure & Dates</h2>

        <p>7.3. Except for any liability that cannot be excluded by law, YRJ and IARCO Team's control (including its officers, employees, and agents) excludes all liability (including negligence), for any personal injury; or any loss or damage (including loss of opportunity); whether direct, indirect, special or consequential, arising in any way out of the promotion, including, but not limited to, where arising out of the following: (a) any technical difficulties or equipment malfunction (whether or not under YRJ and IARCO Team's control); (b) any theft, unauthorized access or third party interference; (c) any entry or prize claim that is late, lost, altered, damaged or misdirected (whether or not after their receipt by IARCO Team) due to any reason beyond the reasonable control of IARCO Team; (d) any variation in prize value to that stated in these Terms and Conditions; (e) any tax liability incurred by a winner or participant; or (f) use of the prizes.</p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>By submitting your entry, you understand that the Promoter, anyone acting on behalf of the Promoter, or its respective licensees, successors, and assigns will have the worldwide irrevocable right to review, print, publish, broadcast, distribute, and use, in any media, in perpetuity, your entry, including without limitation, the entry and your name, portrait, picture, voice, likeness, image or information for trade, advertising, public relations and promotional purposes, without any further compensation.</p>

        <h2>9. Personal Data</h2>

        <p>Any personal information or other information about you collected by the Promoter through, or in connection with, the competition is subject to our Privacy Policy. Your personal data, such as your name and your email address, will be processed by the Promoter for the purposes of your participation in this competition and to provide you with information and promotions about the Promoter and/or any of its affiliates that we deem could be of interest to you. We may share your personal data with our corporate affiliates, claims handlers, and other business partners both within and outside Bangladesh. The Promoter and its affiliates may also use your personal data, combined with information about you obtained from third-party sources, to market our products and services, including special promotions based on your interests.

        <h2>10. Conflict Of Interest</h2>

        <p>All participants in the competition, including hosts, teams, team members, industry mentors, faculty advisors, judges, and graders have an obligation to avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest with their participation. A conflict of interest is any matter that could reasonably be expected to impair an individual's independence and objectivity or interfere with an individual's duties. A conflict may be actual or perceived. For example, a conflict of interest may exist when a participant or a participant's family member or close friend is involved in activities that affect the participant's ability to perform their role fairly and impartially, but conflicts of interest can arise even without a personal relationship. Hosts, mentors, and advisors also have an obligation to avoid purposefully or inadvertently pressuring teams to make a particular investment recommendation.</p>

        <p>To avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, each participant must disclose to the competition team in writing any potential conflicts, including but not limited to any ownership interest in the subject company and any close personal or professional relationships with employees at the subject company. Judges and graders must further disclose any close personal or professional relationship with team members, mentors, or faculty advisors. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed promptly upon becoming aware of the potential conflict.</p>

        <p>The competition management will investigate any disclosures of actual or potential conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest is found to exist and cannot be reasonably and timely cured, the individual with the conflict of interest will be disqualified from participation. If the competition management determines that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the competition, the competition management may disqualify a team from the competition if any team member, industry mentor, or faculty advisor is found to have a conflict of interest that is incapable of being reasonably and timely cured. In extraordinary circumstances where a local level host is found to have a conflict of interest, the competition management may, at its discretion, disqualify the local level host and all teams from that location from participating in the research competition. The decision of the management regarding the existence of a conflict of interest and its determination regarding the disqualification of any individual or team are final and binding.</p>

        <h2>11. Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Plagiarism is defined as copying or using in substantially the same form materials prepared by others without acknowledging the source of the material or identifying the author and publisher of such material. Teams can read existing research on the subject company, but all analysis should be their own; they may not copy analysis (i.e., plagiarize) from another source.</p>

        <p>Allegations of plagiarism will be investigated by the competition management (with assistance as necessary from the local level host) and may be referred to the Professional Conduct Program. Participants found to have plagiarized will be disqualified and reported to the competition management Professional Conduct Program. The decision of the competition management regarding plagiarism is final and binding.</p>

        <h3>Participants also must not:</h3>
        <ul>
