         <p>The International Academic Research Competition (IARCO) is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic integrity and excellence. This document outlines how we assess plagiarism, the penalties associated with it, and provides a detailed breakdown of what constitutes acceptable levels of plagiarism in academic submissions.</p>
   <br>
        <h2>Category</h2>
        <p>IARCO has 2 categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Junior:</strong> Grade/Class 7-12 + Gap Year Students.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior:</strong> University 1st Year to Any Age.</li>
          
        </ul>
        <h2>Selection of Finalists</h2>
        <p>To become a finalist in the IARCO, a contestant’s research proposal must meet the competition’s strict criteria for academic research. We evaluate each submission based on its alignment with the proposal rubric, which assesses aspects such as originality, research methodology, clarity of objectives, and the potential impact of the research. Only those whose proposals meet the expected academic standards are considered for the next stage of the competition, which includes submitting a video pitch to further demonstrate the research.</p>

        <h2>How We Calculate Your Criteria Score</h2>
        <p>Each research proposal is evaluated by two independent judges, who review the proposal based on several predefined criteria. These criteria assess the quality of the research question, the soundness of the methodology, the originality of the approach, and the clarity of the writing. After both judges score the submission, the scores are averaged. The result is rounded down to the nearest whole number to calculate the final criteria score.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>Judge 1 gives a score of 78, and Judge 2 gives a score of 85. The average score is:</p>
        <p class="math">Average Score = (78 + 85) / 2 = 81.5</p>
        <p>This score is rounded down to <strong>81</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Winner Selection Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Research Proposal Evaluation:</strong> The first step is a comprehensive assessment of the written research proposal. Judges review the content for originality, academic rigor, and the clarity of the proposed research question and methodology.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Pitch Evaluation:</strong> After reviewing the written proposals, the judges evaluate the video pitch. The video allows contestants to showcase their ability to communicate their research effectively. The clarity, engagement, and professionalism of the pitch are key elements that contribute to the contestant’s overall score.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How the Video Pitch Affects Your Score</h2>
        <p>The video pitch is an important component of the overall evaluation. It allows judges to assess not only the research proposal but also the contestant’s ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear and engaging manner. It is important to note that the use of AI-generated voices in the video pitch is prohibited. Contestants who use AI voices will face a reduction in their video pitch score. We value authentic, human communication, and contestants are encouraged to present their work in their own voice.</p>

        <h2>Plagiarism Detection and Penalty System</h2>
        <p>Academic integrity is a fundamental aspect of the IARCO. All research proposals are checked using <strong>iThenticate</strong>, an industry-leading plagiarism detection tool. iThenticate is widely used by academic journals, universities, and research institutions worldwide to identify instances of plagiarism and improper citation. It compares the submitted work against an extensive database of academic papers, articles, books, and other publications to detect similarities.</p>

        <h2>What Constitutes Acceptable Levels of Plagiarism?</h2>
        <p>In the IARCO, plagiarism is taken very seriously. We use iThenticate to ensure that every submission is original and appropriately references existing research. However, we recognise that some level of overlap with existing literature is inevitable, particularly when discussing widely recognised theories, concepts, or well-established research in the field. The following criteria outline acceptable and unacceptable levels of plagiarism in the competition:</p>

        <h3>0% to 5% Plagiarism (Unacceptable)</h3>
        <p>A plagiarism level of 0% to 5% is considered unacceptable in the IARCO, even though it might seem like a small amount. This typically indicates a failure to provide proper citations for sources that have been used in the proposal. It is essential that all references to previous work, whether they are ideas, phrases, or data, are properly credited to the original authors. A lack of citations or the omission of a comprehensive literature review demonstrates poor academic practice and undermines the credibility of the research. Contestants with 0% to 5% plagiarism will receive a <strong>15-point penalty</strong>.</p>

        <h3>6% to 20% Plagiarism (Acceptable for Most Submissions)</h3>
        <p>A plagiarism percentage between 6% and 20% is generally acceptable, as long as it is the result of appropriate and well-cited use of existing literature. In academic research, it is common to reference established theories, findings, or data that are widely recognised in the field. As long as the sources are cited correctly and there is no indication of intentional plagiarism or copying without proper attribution, this level of overlap is considered acceptable. Contestants with plagiarism in this range will <strong>not incur any penalty</strong>.</p>

        <h3>21% to 30% Plagiarism (Moderate Concern)</h3>
        <p>A plagiarism level between 21% and 30% raises significant concerns, as it suggests that a substantial portion of the research proposal may not be sufficiently original or that there are issues with citation. This range indicates that the contestant may have relied too heavily on existing work without adequately paraphrasing or properly citing the sources. Contestants who fall into this category will receive a <strong>20-point penalty</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Above 30% Plagiarism (Unacceptable and Severe Penalty)</h3>
        <p>A plagiarism percentage above 30% is considered <strong>unacceptable</strong> in the IARCO. At this level, the contestant’s work contains a high proportion of copied content, which indicates a failure to produce original research or a blatant disregard for proper citation practices. This degree of plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity and will result in a <strong>30-point penalty</strong>.</p>

        <h2>How the Plagiarism Penalty Works</h2>
        <p>To clarify the impact of plagiarism on a contestant’s final score, consider the following example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Paper Score:</strong> 68/100</li>
            <li><strong>Presentation Score:</strong> 75/100</li>
            <li><strong>Plagiarism Percentile:</strong> 39%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The plagiarism percentage is 39%, which is above the threshold for severe plagiarism. As a result, the contestant would incur a <strong>30-point penalty</strong>. The <strong>Submission Score</strong> (Research Proposal + Presentation) before applying the plagiarism penalty would be:</p>
        <p class="math">Submission Score = 68 + 75 = 143/200</p>
        <p>After the penalty is applied:</p>
        <p class="math">Final Adjusted Score = 143 - 30 = 113</p>
        <p>The contestant’s <strong>Final Score</strong> would be <strong>113/200</strong>, reflecting both the quality of the research and the consequences of plagiarism.</p>

        <h2>How Our Ranking Leaderboard Works</h2>
        <p>Once all submissions have been evaluated and scored, the final leaderboard is determined. Contestants with the highest scores will be ranked at the top, while those with lower scores will follow accordingly. If two contestants have identical scores, a secondary ranking criterion is applied: the contestant with the lowest level of plagiarism will be ranked higher.</p>
        <p>The leaderboard features the following recognitions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gold Medalist:</strong> The contestant with the highest overall score.</li>
            <li><strong>Silver Medalist:</strong> The second-highest score.</li>
            <li><strong>Bronze Medalist:</strong> The third-highest score.</li>
            <li><strong>Honourable Mentions:</strong> The next 4 to 10 highest-scoring contestants who demonstrated exceptional academic achievement.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Custom Rank URL:</h2>
<p>To further celebrate each contestant’s achievement, we provide a Custom Rank URL. Contestants can generate this URL by double-clicking on their name in the leaderboard. The link can be shared on social media or with peers, and it will display the contestant’s rank and highlight their name, allowing them to proudly share their success.</p>

      <h2>At the End</h2>
      <p>The International Academic Research Competition is designed to uphold the highest standards of academic excellence and integrity. By using iThenticate, we ensure that all submissions are checked for plagiarism and that contestants who fail to properly credit existing research are penalised. Understanding the acceptable levels of plagiarism and adhering to proper citation practices are key to succeeding in the competition. Contestants are encouraged to submit original work, carefully citing all sources, and to present their research clearly and effectively. This comprehensive evaluation process ensures that the best research is recognised, and that academic integrity is maintained throughout the competition.</p>
